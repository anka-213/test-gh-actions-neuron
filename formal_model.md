# Formal model

Real {contracts,programs} are large and complex.
They are written in an unsuitable language for formal representation, e.g. {English,Python}.

To make it easier to test/reason about {contracts,programs}, we can build a _model_ in some formal language. This model is a simplification of the underlying {contract,program}.

"[All models are wrong, some are useful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong)".


### Languages in which to build models

- Logics:
  - Deontic logic
  - Propositional dynamic logic
- Prisacariu, Schneider (2009): [Contract Language](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~gersch/icail09.pdf)
- Mart√≠nez et al. (2010): [C-O diagrams](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~gersch/scc2010.pdf)
- Gulliksson, Camilleri (2016): [Simplified Contract Language](http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/243893/243893.pdf)

See the following list for languages that have an entry in this zettelkasten. TODO: add a tag "language/formal" and only link to them.

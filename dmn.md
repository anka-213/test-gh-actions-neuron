# DMN

DMN (Decision Model and Notation) is a modeling language for specifying decisions and rules.

## DMN2RuleML

There is a tool available for converting DMN decision tables into RuleML, on which
<legalruleml> is based, called [DMN2RuleML](http://stark-cove-78485.herokuapp.com/decision-table).

## Stuff moved here from other articles

* A single row of a DMN decision table is referred to as a "rule" in the spec,
which is confusing.

* Related: <dmn_constraint_tables_extension>

* For implementation of DMN-related things, see Calvanese et al (2016)
[Semantics and Analysis of DMN Decision Tables](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07466.pdf).

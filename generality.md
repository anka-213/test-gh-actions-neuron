# Generality

Event `A` is more general than event `B`, iff every instance of `B` is also an instance of `A`.

Example from <normalized_legal_drafting_query_method>

* "penalty" is more general than "fine"
* "penalty" is more general than "imprisonment"

### Colloquial usage of "generalization"

Paraphrased from a [Finnish source](http://sange.fi/~atehwa/cgi-bin/piki.cgi/yleistys), so trust my word. :-P /Inari

Consider the following statements and their (unjustified) conclusions:

* All humans can walk
  * conclusion: All mammals can walk
* It's sunny today
  * conclusion: It's sunny always

Despite colloquial usage, these conclusions are not generalisations.

_Mammal_ is a generalization of _human_, and _always_ is a generalization of _today_.
But the statement "it's sunny always" is __not__ a generalization of "it's sunny today".

In all worlds where it's sunny _always_, it is also sunny _today_. So the logically correct direction is:

* _it's sunny today_ is a generalization of _it's sunny always_.

### Questions

Is this confusion about generality of statements relevant in legal contracts?

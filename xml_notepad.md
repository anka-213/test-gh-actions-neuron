# XML Notepad

XML Notepad is a C# application for Windows [available on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/XmlNotepad) that is designed to allow
you to validate your XML document in real time against the XML Schema.

Jason is currently testing it as a tool for editing <legalruleml> and <akoma_ntoso> documents.

If you're going to try it, ignore the official "releases" and just download the current codebase in the master branch.

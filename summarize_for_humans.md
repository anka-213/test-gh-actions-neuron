# Classification and summarization

Human volunteers go through a <legal_contract> like license agreement or privacy policy, and write a human-readable summary. Examples:
- [ToS;DR](https://tosdr.org/)
- [tl;dr Legal](https://tldrlegal.com/)

[Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) has a three-layer design:
- Legal code
- Human readable
- Machine-readable

# Create formal models of legal text

Premise: we have a contract written by humans for humans, but we want to automate certain interesting tasks.

1. Human-written document in natural language.
2. Translate the original document into a <formal_model>.
3. Do useful things with the model:
    - <automatic_contract_processing>
    - <legal_expert_systems>


Contrast with rules as code: step 1 is eliminated, rules are written directly as code.

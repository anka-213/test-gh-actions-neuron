# A Manual of Style for Contract Drafting (Adams 2004)

[adamsdrafting.com/writing/mscd/](https://www.adamsdrafting.com/writing/mscd/)

> With A Manual of Style for Contract Drafting, Kenneth A. Adams has created a uniquely in-depth survey of the building blocks of contract language. First published in 2004, it offers those who draft, review, negotiate, or interpret contracts an alternative to the dysfunction of traditional contract language and the inertia and flawed conventional wisdom that perpetuate it. This manual has become a vital resource throughout the legal profession, in the United States and internationally.

# PSOA RuleML

[PSOA RuleML](https://github.com/RuleML/psoa-ruleml) is a "Positional-Slotted, Object Applicative" version of RuleML.

Which if I'm understanding correctly, means that instead of being required to use
predicates for everything, you can use a more object-oriented style data structure
and your objects have named attributes, more in the style of F-Logic and Flora-2.

Things encoded in PSOA RuleML that can be executed in Java using a compiler called
[PSOA TransRun](https://wiki.ruleml.org/index.php/PSOATransRun_Development_Tutorial).

TODO: Figure out what the relationship is between PSOA RuleML and LegalRuleML.

# LEOS

[LEOS (Legislative Editing Open Software)](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/solution/leos-open-source-software-editing-legislation) is the open source version
of a piece of software developed for use inside the European Union for drafting software, called "EdiT" (), which is intended to work as a replacement
for their current tool, called LegisWrite, which is a Microsoft Word add-on.

It is like a project management tool for legislative drafting in a complicated environment, allowing for features like translations, reviewers, etc.

It is not clear whether it is actually being used in production, yet. It is described as a pilot.

It uses <akoma_ntoso> as its storage language for the legislative texts.

It is potentially relevant to our work in that it is open source, and it is a platform for legislative drafting. It is the sort of thing
that Rules as Code capabilities could be added to for demonstration purposes, so that legislative drafters could see how the ability
to encode a law and have automated tests and fact scenarios is something that might enhance the drafting process.

It is focused on the project management aspects of legislative drafting, not the actual drafting process. As a result it is a somewhat clumsy
editor. That may interfere with its adoption outside of the EU.

# Visualization

Visual representations of legal text, in order to make it easier for humans to read.

### Diagrams

- [C-O diagrams](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~gersch/scc2010.pdf)
- Diagram notation in <normalized_legal_drafting_query_method>
- Graphs generated from licenses at [Licentia](http://licentia.inria.fr/visualize/licAPACHE)

### Formatting

More low-key visualization aid.
* Break down sentences into smaller chunks
* Use bullet points
* Use indentation
* Use hyphens or parentheses to avoid attachment ambiguity

Example from [Camilleri (2017)](https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/53815/1/gupea_2077_53815_1.pdf):

```
if {the flight} leaves {in two hours} then both
  - {the ground crew} must open {the check-in desk}
  - {the ground crew} must request {the passenger manifest}
```

(The particular example also happens to be a <cnl> that compiles to a formal representation. But this is an orthogonal question.)

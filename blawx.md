# Blawx

[Blawx](https://www.blawx.com) is a visual develepment environment for a subset of
ErgoLite, which is the open source
version of <ergoai_ergolite>, also known as Flora-2. It is aimed at creating an
easy-to-learn interface for open-source declarative logic programming for use in
Rules as Code.

It uses the Blockly library from google to create ErgoLite code, and offers an API
to a ErgoLite reasoner online that accepts code and queries in the Blawx format,
and data in JSON.

It is integrated with <docassemble> for use in expert systems through the
docassemble-blawx module.

Jason wrote it.

There is an [online live demo](http://app.blawx.com/blawx.html).

# Smart contract

A smart contract is a <contract> where some part of the
terms has been represented in code (or possibly in
some other way) to allow parts of the
contract to be executed automatically, or to allow
analysis of the contract.

"Smart contracts" are often mistakenly conflated with contracts that
use blockchain to record information and exchange currency. See <blockchain_and_smart_contracts>.

Any type of contract can be a smart contract.

The definition of a contract includes legally enforced
obligations. Arguably, if two people have agreed to abide by the outcomes of a piece of software without recourse the courts,
such as in a distributed autonomous organization, then
the term "contract" doesn't properly apply. A contract
is a legally enforceable promise. If there is no intent
to be able to use the legal system to enforce the promise,
it may not be a contract at all.

A difficult issue in smart contracts is how to have the
power of the courts apply to the interpretation of the
contract and its enforceability, if the primary intent
of the party is expressed in code. This is generally
addressed by a dual contract, where the intent is
expressed both in code and in natural language text that is intended to
convey the same meaning.

For example, the Clause.io system allows you to drag and
drop pre-written paragraphs of text into an agreement,
each having an associated block of code that can be used
to automate the same intent.
